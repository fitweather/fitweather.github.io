# Problem Statement:

Some people do not like the weather of the city that they live in but they do not know how to find the city with
suitable weather conditions for them. This app provides a list of recommended cities according to the user’s
preferences. This app reduces the effort for users to find a city with suitable weather.

# User Goal:

The user has to find a city or a location with a preferable weather which will be comforting to the user.

# User Action:

- The user can complete a questionnaire and list their preferences according to the choices mentioned in the
  questionnaire, for example, if the user prefers sunny weather, they would have to fill out “sunny” in the preferences
  tab. The users can get recommendations based on the answer of the questionnaire.

- The user will also be able to get details about the weather history of a certain city or a certain location. The user
  will also get details from the application about the weather details of a certain city or a location, such as the
  precipitation rate or the average wind speed in a day.

- The user can get other useful information such as the air pollution levels of a city or a location or even the air
  quality index (AQI) of a location.

- The user can give two cities as inputs and the user will be able to compare the weather of these two cities.

# User Potential Obstacles

The score of two cities may be equal. Users may still take efforts to select the city manually.
